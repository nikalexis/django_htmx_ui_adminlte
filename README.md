## What is `django_htmx_ui_adminlte` library

This library uses the [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/docs/3.2/index.html) template
combined with the [django_htm_ui library](https://pypi.org/project/django-htmx-ui/)
to include [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/),
[django-htmx](https://django-htmx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) capibilities.

This is under heavy development right now.
